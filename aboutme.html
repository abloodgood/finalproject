                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Ashley! I was born in Neptune, NJ and grew up in Bayville, NJ. I have two sisters and growing up I had 
                    two dogs and two cats. I enjoyed high school and was in the French, Math, and Science honor societies. I attended
                    Drew University for my Bachelor's degree in Physics. Drew is a beautiful, small liberal arts college in Madison, NJ.
                    Some of my favorite classes in college were linear algebra, quantum mechanics, and latin. I tutored both physics and latin
                    and also worked at the physics department's observatory at night. I was in the Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Pi Sigma, and Pi Mu Epsilon
                    honor societies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After college, I went to work at Lockheed Martin as a systems engineer. Working at Lockheed Martin was challenging but fun. 
                    I mainly worked on the integration and test of the AEGIS defense system. I also wrote and reviewed specifications, made changes
                    to our simulation code, wrote test procedures, and attended formal test events. I learned so much about defense systems and systems
                    engineering at this job. I decided to leave after 4.5 years to pursue an opportunity at Saab. Now I am working at Saab as a systems 
                    engineer. I am mostly working on writing new specifications for components of their defense system. I also do some work in cybersecurity
                    as well. I use a lot of the skills I learned at LM but I'm also learning new ones. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I live in Hamilton, NJ with my dog and cats. My younger sister also lives with me. With my new job, I work at home. I am currently
                    pursuing a Master's degree in Software Development at Boston University. I enjoy reading, travelling, cooking, baking, and crocheting. Most 
                    days you can find me reading on the couch with my dog on my lap!
