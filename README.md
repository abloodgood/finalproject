# finalproject
final project for BU MET CS 601

The goal of this project is to develop a personal website for myself. I wanted to keep it relatively simple as I am a simple person with underdeveloped creativity. I wanted to keep the website mostly professional with my resume, bio, ways to find me on the web, and a contact form. I also added a "favorite places" page because I love travelling and wanted to include one of my personal interests! My website uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, VUE, and I used CSS FlexBox to make my pages responsive.
